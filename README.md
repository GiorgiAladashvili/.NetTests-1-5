# C# Practice Tasks

This repository contains a collection of small algorithmic problems
solved in **C#**.\
Each task is implemented in its own class for clarity and practice
purposes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

-   **PalindromeChecker**\
    Checks if a given string is a palindrome (ignores spaces, case, and
    non-alphanumeric characters).

-   **CoinCalculator**\
    Calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount
    using coin denominations {1, 5, 10, 20, 50}.

-   **ArrayTasks**\
    Finds the smallest positive integer greater than 0 that does not
    appear in the given array.

-   **BracketChecker**\
    Validates whether a string of parentheses is properly balanced.

-   **Staircase**\
    Counts the number of ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps,
    moving 1 or 2 steps at a time (Fibonacci-based solution).
